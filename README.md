# English-to-Hindi Translation System

This project implements an English-to-Hindi translation system using Python. The system leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to translate English sentences into Hindi. It also evaluates the translations using standard metrics like BLEU scores.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Handles data loading and preparation for training and evaluation.
- **Translation Techniques**:
  - Utilizes tokenization and other preprocessing methods for effective text representation.
  - Includes mechanisms for training models or evaluating pre-existing translation capabilities.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The translation quality is evaluated using BLEU scores, a widely-used metric in machine translation.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Core language for implementing the translation system.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **nltk**: For tokenization and BLEU score evaluation.
- **scikit-learn**: For text feature extraction and similarity measurements.
- **matplotlib**: For visualizing results and metrics.
- **collections**: For managing data structures efficiently.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Loading**: Prepares and loads datasets for translation, handling missing or inconsistent data.
2. **Preprocessing**: Tokenizes and normalizes text for effective translation.
3. **Translation Model**: Implements or integrates a model for translating English text into Hindi.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluates the translation quality using metrics like BLEU scores to compare the generated output against reference translations.
5. **Visualization**: Visualizes evaluation metrics and translation patterns.
